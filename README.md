# Labs for Computer Vision 1 course, MSc AI @ UvA 2019.

## Assignment 1: Photometric Stereo & Color
Assignment on classical Computer Vision topics and their implementation. [Report](https://github.com/ancadiana23/ComputerVision1Labs/blob/master/Reports/Report_1.pdf) and [Code](https://github.com/ancadiana23/ComputerVision1Labs/tree/master/1)

## Assignment 2: Neighborhood Processing & Filters
Assignment on several filter techniques (e.g. Gaussian, Gabor), edge detection and fore- background separation [Report](https://github.com/ancadiana23/ComputerVision1Labs/blob/master/Reports/Report_2.pdf) and [Code](https://github.com/ancadiana23/ComputerVision1Labs/tree/master/2)

## Assignment 3: Harric Corner Detector & Optical Flow
Assignment on the Harris Corner Detector, Optical Flow with the Lucas-Kanade Algorithm and a simple Feature Tracking algorithm [Report](https://github.com/ancadiana23/ComputerVision1Labs/blob/master/Reports/Report_3.pdf) and [Code](https://github.com/ancadiana23/ComputerVision1Labs/tree/master/3)

## Assignment 4: Image Alignment & Stitching
Assignment on Image Alignment including interest points, SIFT features, the RANSAC algorithm and keypoint matching. Furthermore Image Stitching of two corresponding images is performed. [Report](https://github.com/ancadiana23/ComputerVision1Labs/blob/master/Reports/Report_4.pdf) and [Code](https://github.com/ancadiana23/ComputerVision1Labs/tree/master/4)

# Final Project
## Part 1: Bag of Words based Image Classification
Image classification bsaed on SIFT features on the STL10 dataset. [Code](https://github.com/ancadiana23/ComputerVision1Labs/tree/master/final_project)

## Part 2: CNN based Image Classification
Image classification based on CNNs with several advanced strategies such as data augmentation, freezing early layers and trying deeper networks. [Report](https://github.com/ancadiana23/ComputerVision1Labs/blob/master/Reports/Final_Report_2.pdf) and [Code](https://github.com/ancadiana23/ComputerVision1Labs/tree/master/final_project)
