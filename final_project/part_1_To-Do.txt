DATASET:
	- 5 classes: airplanes, birds, ships, horses and cars [STL-10 dataset]
	- For each class: 500 training images, 800 testing images (96x96 RGB)
	- http://ai.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/stl10_matlab.tar.gz
	- only use 'train.mat' and 'test.mat' file (not 'unlabeled.mat')



Approach:
	- Bag of Words: see "http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~az/icvss08_az_bow.pdf"




1.1 Training Phase:

1.2 Testing Phase:



2 Bag-of-Words based Image Classification

	1. Feature extraction and description
	2. Building a visual vocabulary
	3. Quantize features using visual dictionary (encoding)
	4. Representing images by frequencies of visual words
	5. Classification
